## Welcome to TrashAware!
TrashAware is a mobile app to enable a community to share sustainability information about their purchases from connected shopping accounts (Walmart, Amazon, Costco, ...).
Shopping carts are monitored and warnings issued about bad trash generating products explaining why they are trashy. Alternatives are proposed so users can replace trashy items with one tap.

## Features
Community votes determine product sustainability grades and explanations. 
Users also nominate and vote on suggested alternatives.
Abuse mitigation:
Voting restricted to own purchases from real shopping accounts.
More weight to votes that predict how other high weight users vote.
Machine Learning infers missing information based on votes about similar products.

## Benefits
TrashAware helps its community improve shopping habits. Users will promote it to family and friends because as it grows popular they will gain economic power to stop environmental travesties like the plastics industry recycling fraud: https://youtu.be/PJnJ8mK3Q3g 
Financial incentives created by TrashAware will push manufacturers, sellers, and even reluctant consumers to green products in a self-sustaining positive sum feedback loop -- a virtuous cycle towards a cleaner, greener, healthier planet!
